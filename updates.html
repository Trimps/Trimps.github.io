<span style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold; display: block; width: 100%; text-align: center">Trimps Updates!</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">2.3 - 9/23/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added new challenge at zone 70</li>
	<li>Added new perk from new challenge</li>
	<li>Added new job at 70 that synergizes with the new perk.</li>
	<li>Loot rewards now give about 3.5 seconds worth of production for food, wood, and metal before looting/map loot bonuses (5 seconds after zone 100). This is a buff to some zones, not a buff for others, but map loot is now stable and meaningful throughout the game. This is hopefully the final zone/map resource change.</li>
	<li>Gem loot from maps, world, and imps now also increased to always stay close to tributes.</li>
	<li>Added boss to Trimple Of Doom who drops 4x food compared to a normal square, but is stronger than a Snimp.</li>
	<li>You no longer have to clear The Prison every single run in order to unlock Electricity. One time is enough.</li>
	<li>Buildings, jobs, and upgrades unlock to the same position they would go to on save load. Rearranged some buildings and upgrades to keep them close to like-minded individuals.</li>
	<li>Added hotkeys for formations. You can now press X, H, D, B, or 1, 2, 3, 4 to switch.</li>
	<li>Added colors to perks based on purchasability</li>
	<li>Changed the way numbers display when purchasing perks. If you have 6 levels in a perk already confirmed then go to add 1 more, instead of saying "0 (+7)" like before, it will show "7 (+1)". The first number will be the total level after you press confirm, and the parenthesized number will be how many are not yet confirmed.</li>
	<li>Perk price no longer displays in the tooltip if you're at the max</li>
	<li>Made a few alignment tweaks with the UI</li>
	<li>The Save Import feature now can detect and remove whitespace and line breaks automatically, fixing issues for some people who were saving their export in weird text editors or emailing their saves and stuff.</li>
	<li>Added indicator to the save button which lets you know at a glance if autosave is on or off</li>
	<li>Added Gigastation to the list of "dangerous upgrades", so like wormhole it now has a confirmation popup that can be disabled in the settings.</li>

	<li><i>Almost every addition in this patch is a suggestion from the communities at Reddit and Kongregate. You guys are awesome and keep me motivated to continue giving this game love. Thanks for all of the support.</i></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">2.213 - 9/14/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added a third mode for the progress bar setting called "Performance Bars". This setting will still display the bars, but disable the smooth animation. This will bring the CPU load down to about the same as disabling the bars if you need it, but you can still see them if that's your thing.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">2.212 - 9/12/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added new option to disable progress bar animations</li>
	<li>Optimized the number and bar updating from battles to reduce CPU usage</li>
	<li>Added a confirmation pop-up to Wormholes, and added an option to disable this confirmation if you don't like it.</li>
	<li>Added some placeholder '0's to the time since last portal clock</li>
	<li>A few bug fixes for small display issues</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">2.211 - 9/12/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>The tooltips setting now includes formations, and the description has been changed to say that it affects button tooltips</li>
	<li>Added option to disable the menu number formatting I added in the last patch</li>
	<li>Made the settings button text more visible on laptop resolutions</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">2.21 - 9/11/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>I didn't change the What's New button color because I like this one and think it's pretty obvious there was a patch.</li>
	<li>Added 'Settings' button to the bar at the bottom. Click it to show/hide some extra settings</li>
	<li>Added 3 new settings and moved autosave, notation, and delete save to settings menu. I can now easily add more settings and options to this menu, let me know if there's something you'd like to be able to turn off or on! (Not including people, sorry)</li>
	<li>Building and job numbers are now formatted</li>
	<li>Added time since last portal counter</li>
	<li>Using bones on helium now properly adds the helium to the total helium earned counter</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">2.2 - 9/9/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Changed icons for a few items</li>
	<li>While a few items from maps and the world had descriptions or titles when you moused over them before, now everything does!</li>
	<li>Further increased loot rewards from 60+ maps. The map you're running must be within 3 levels of the zone you're on to receive this bonus.</li>
	<li>Added a new Unique Map which can be found in any level 80+ normal map</li>
	<li>Clearing the new Unique Map will unlock a new, longer, hopefully awesome challenge. This challenge is repeatable and rewards helium instead of a perk. The new map must be cleared each run in order to activate the challenge.</li>
	<li>Gymystic now drops once every 25 zones from 75-150</li>
	<li>Gigastations now drop every 5 zones from 90-130 (Up from every 10 zones through 120)</li>
	<li>Gave some more space to the custom button</li>
	<li>Rewrote the Agility perk tooltip to hopefully make more sense</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">2.111 - 9/3/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Bug fix for total helium earned counter</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">2.11 - 9/2/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added 'Scientist II' challenge to Zone 50, allowing upgrade to the new and shiny Mk. III Portal</li>
	<li>Added total helium earned counter to portal and view perks menus</li>
	<li>Respeccing your perks no longer automatically clears all of your perks. Added a 'Clear All' button to the respec screen. (You can now just remove points from one perk without wiping everything if you want)</li>
	<li>The 'Custom' number button has been split in half. The left half, when clicked, will automatically switch to the last custom number you entered without the input popup. The right half will bring up the input popup like before.</li>
	<li>Food, wood, and metal that drop from the world and maps are now more plentiful. This new number takes your maximum Trimp population in to account when scaling loot rewards, to try and stay valuable compared to gathering. This is not yet perfect at every stage of the game (still a little low late game), but is a good starting place and I will be continuing to work on it over the next few weeks.</li>
	<li>Boosted map loot rewards from most of the unique maps</li>
	<li>Added extra tooltips where people were looking for extra info</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">2.1 - 8/26/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added 4 new upgrades to maps between Zones 18 and 47, all of which boost housing</li>
	<li>After the first time you ever complete Dimension of Anger, you will automatically receive helium for each Blimp at Zone 21 and above. You will still have to clear Dimension of Anger to unlock portal, but will no longer miss helium if you AFK through 20+</li>
	<li>If you do not have enough Max Trimps for Coordination, the message now lets you know how short you are.</li>
	<li>Tauntimp is no longer fast, and now attacks second.</li>
	<li>Added shiny loot text for exotic imports, and you can now continue to see the imports already unlocked from inside the bone trader screen.</li>
	<li>Added new challenge which is available the first time you unlock Portal, and added new cheap/low level perk as reward.</li>
	<li>The Metal challenge now unlocks at 25 instead of on your second Portal</li>
	<li>Renovated the layout of the Portal/Challenge screen</li>
	<li>Challenges are now grey after they've been completed</li>
	<li>In the View Perks menu while on a challenge, you can now see which challenge you are on and what you're supposed to do</li>
	<li>You can now purchase more than 1 perk at a time</li>
	<li>You can now remove 1 or more levels of a perk that has been added since your last commit (if you make a mistake, you can remove that point without starting over)</li>
	<li>If you do not have enough max Trimps for Coordination, the button will grey out, and the information about how many Trimps you need is now placed in the tooltip instead of a log message.</li>
	<li>Gigastation now drops less frequently past zone 70, and stops at zone 120 to allow room for new content</li>
	<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">2.01 - 8/23/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Bug fixes</li>
	<li>Some slight balance tweaks to enemy damage/hp scale rate past 60 and the new housing unit</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">2.0 "Broken Planet" - 8/22/15</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: bold">Your scientists have detected an anomaly at the end of Zone 59. Destroying the anomaly will wreak havoc on your planet.</li>
	<li>New Zone 60+ content including 8 new upgrades, a huge shift in battle mechanics, 3 "formations", a new challenge/perk, a new upgradable housing building, and vastly increased rewards at the end of each zone.</li>
	<li>Removed the cap on the custom number button, made the game much faster at handling and calculating large purchases</li>
	<li>Soldier Trimps can now pick up new equipment in between battles to gain benefit without having to die first</li>
	<li>Redesigned the battle info panel to be way easier to read and hopefully look nicer with no overlap on all screen sizes</li>
	<li>Your highest amount of helium earned in one portal is now stored and offered as a replacement to the old Bone Trader Helium calculation once that number is higher. This updates after using the portal, and does not include helium spent on Wormholes</li>
	<li>The last Gymystic drop is now at 55. The later ones have been replaced by more exciting things.</li>
	<li>Added 17 new story messages</li>
	<li>Bone trader window now opens instantly instead of fading in</li>
	<li>Added icons for Bad guys that have first srike or other active bonuses.</li>
	<li>Some text and spacing fixes in the log</li>
	<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.1 - 8/15/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added information to max trimps. Click your total Trimps to see this information.</li>
	<li>Prestiging your equipment now includes the cost of the level 1 item, and reduces the equipment to level 1 instead of 0.</li>
	<li>New upgrade for Gyms drops at zone 25, and then every 5 levels after that. If you were at or past zone 25 when this patch came out, the appropriate amount of upgrades will be unlocked for you automatically.</li>
	<li>Added new housing building to zone 50 maps.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.096 - 8/13/15</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: bold">Note: I'm working on a lot of 'quality of life' and UI patches this week. I'm waiting for the dust to settle from the two new perks, then I'll be shifting back towards content additions where they are needed</li>
	<li>You can now see how long it will take for your storages to fill up</li>
	<li>Changed some of the color shades of the progress bars to make text easier to read</li>
	<li>Redid the design of the buildings queue to no longer use a progress bar. This gives some extra space to the large menu below it, and is hopefully way less obnoxious once your building speed gets high.</li>
	<li>Made buttons more readable</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.095 - 8/12/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added stat breakdown for Block, Attack and Health, which can be opened by clicking your Trimps' block, attack or health.</li>
	<li>Completing the Scientist challenge now gives one additional reward. If you have already completed this challenge, you don't need to do it again.</li>
	<li>Buildings progress bar now properly resets after portal</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.094 - The Next Day But Still Technically 8/10/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added a ton of information if you click the "+#/sec" text for food, wood, metal, science, gems, fragments, and trimps. If you haven't used the portal since 1.093, these numbers may or may not be slightly inaccurate until you portal.</li>
	<li>Speedminer no longer drops during the Metal challenge. If you abandon or complete the challenge, you'll instantly unlock all of the books you missed.</li>
	<li>Wormhole now spawns at 37 instead of 35 and has bold text in the tooltip warning that it costs helium.</li>
	<li>Made it more obvious that the reset button is a hard-reset</li>
	<li>The "Maps/World" button now takes you to the Map Chamber instead of The World if you're in a map when you click it.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue with buildings queue not properly refunding certain items in stacks</li>
	<li>The number of Trimps fighting no longer prematurely updates when purchasing coordination</li>
	<li>You no longer sometimes lose a random group of available Trimps when purchasing coordination</li>
	<li>Switching from the maps chamber to maps or the world will properly update your stats before the battle begins if auto-battle is off.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.093 - 8/10/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Relentlessness no longer shows that you crit if your Trimps die before getting the crit off</li>
	<li>If you try to purchase more workers than your currently available workspaces, the game will now attempt to fill your workspaces out (if you can still afford the resource cost) instead of just failing.</li>
	<li>Increased the amount of gems from maps and Dragimps (the ones that spawn in zones). Feyimp is now closer to 10X a gem square from a map of the same level when taking into account all factors. This won't ever be exactly 10x, as the loot bonus varies between maps</li>
	<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.092 - 8/9/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added new challenge which becomes accessible once you've reached zone 40. This gives something different than a perk.</li>
	<li>Added confirmation tooltip to the 'abandon challenge' button</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.091 - 8/7/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added bone trader.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.09 - 8/6/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added two 'Challenges'. The first is unlocked at your second portal, the second is unlocked at 35. Now that the groundwork has been done, if people enjoy these I will make more.</li>
	<li>Added two new perks as rewards for the challenges.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.081 - 8/4/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Cleared out many of the smaller bugs that have been around for a while, such as the map borders sticking, certain numbers not resetting after portal, and other small fixes. Thank you to everyone on Kongregate and Reddit who have been reporting bugs.</li>
	<li>Reworded Relentlessness tooltip</li>
	<li>The Block now drops from level 11 maps, regardless of shield level. The block is now a level 11 map, but the difficulty has been reduced so it should feel about the same, but give more loot</li>
	<li>Packrat now gives 10% storage space per level, up from 5.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.08 - 8/1/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>You can now spend leftover helium in the 'View Perks' menu without using a respec. I'm sorry it hasn't always been like this.</li>
	<li>Added new type of building to maps at or around 23</li>
	<li>Added some more information to tooltips</li>
	<li>Added new Unique Map with a new type of drop to 33</li>
	<li>Recycling a map no longer clears your advanced map settings</li>
	<li>Gems and fragments now generate while offline</li>
	<li>Wormhole now teleports your Trimps to planets capable of housing more Trimps, and has been redesigned by top scientists to use less helium</li>
	<li>New rare bad guys, Skeletimp and Megaskeletimp now roam the worlds. They'll drop something fun soon.</li>
	<li>Added a few more story messages</li>
	<li>Standardized the first map you receive</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.07 - 7/25/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Maps created are categorized as loot instead of notices</li>
	<li>New late game housing building</li>
	<li>Mansions now give +10 max Trimps, up from +8</li>
	<li>Wood and food cost on houses has been swapped. It felt like wood was too high in demand when houses are being built. It still makes sense, you need food in houses for them to eat and stuff.</li>
	<li>Gems now drop in higher quantities at higher frequencies from maps.</li>
	<li>Hotels now appear a level earlier</li>
	<li>Reduced the prestige scaling cost of equipment</li>
	<li>Added a new thing around zone 15 from maps</li>
	<li>Coordination requires 3x your current soldiers, down from 4. Added more info to the message stating how many Trimps you need for the next level if you can't afford it.</li>
	<li>Added new perk that increases fight speed, but has a cap. It gives -5% speed that compounds/deprecates each time. At the cap (20 stacks), it will increase fight speed by 65%.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.06 - 7/22/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Fragments are now categorized as loot instead of upgrades</li>
	<li>Fragment drops scale based on zone</li>
	<li>Cost of creating maps scales based on level being created</li>
	<li>Loot, size, difficulty, and biome can now be adjusted, granting less randomness for extra fragments.</li>
	<li>Remade the buttons in the maps select area to eat up less space and look nicer on more resolutions</li>
	<li>Workspaces text now fits on one line on hopefully all resolutions</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.05 - 7/21/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added new upgrade that teaches foremen how to be less lazy when there's nothing to build.</li>
	<li>Custom number field gets automatically preselected, pressing the escape key closes tooltips (Thanks to Stevie-O!)</li>
	<li>Added new bad guy to watery regions.</li>
	<li>Fixed the map repeat and auto fight buttons not properly resetting.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.04 - 7/18/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added ability to create maps at different levels. Note that I am still working on an optional, more advanced map creation UI and better filters/recycling, but I finished this part and figured people would enjoy it, so here it is!</li>
	<li>Seirimp's loot has been brought down just a hair to make it feel less like you have to farm mountains. Once the advanced maps UI is in place and it's easier to get a map you want, I will add more farmable bad guys to specific biomes.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.03 - 7/16/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added new perk - <b>Packrat</b> - which increases the amount of stuff you can fit in Barns, Forges, and Sheds.</li>
	<li>Added new bad guy to mountainous regions</li>
	<li>Added a few new housing options for all you late gamers</li>
	<li>Weapon damage now scales closer to health when prestiging your equipment. This change should apply retroactively!</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.02 - 7/14/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added more information about prestiges to the upgrade tooltips. I want to see if this helps retain the strategy of choosing when to prestige without getting surprised.</li>
	<li>Added more maps that drop food and wood</li>
	<li>Added Grimps to guard the forests, just in case</li>
	<li>Different bad guys have different stats, bosses have some extra health</li>
	<li>Fixed bug with Tribute</li>
	<li>Fixed issue causing metal to randomly reset to 0</li>
	<li>The custom number field now remembers the last number you put in it</li>
	<li>Fixed import/export box being off screen on some resolutions</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.01 - 7/13/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Increased spawn rate of resources in maps</li>
	<li>Added option to reset your portal bonuses. You can reset once per run.</li>
	<li>Clicking cancel after choosing portal bonuses reverts your selections.</li>
	<li>Fixed a lot of bugs and exploits</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">1.0 - 7/12/15</span>
<ul>
	<li>Bumped up the rewards from battle a bit.</li>
	<li>So many bug fixes</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue with upgrades not spawning in the right spot</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug with post-upgrade shields, reduced value a bit</li>
	<li>Buildings queue handles multiple purchases much more gracefully</li>
	<li>Fixed prestige values and costs</li>
	<li>Messages are color coded a little better now. I think these colors stand out well on the background and are easy to read, but if someone has trouble reading them let me know.</li>
	<li>Added offline progress for food, wood, and metal.</li>
	<li>Changed barns, sheds, and forge to increase your max by 100%, price is the same.</li>
	<li>Switched back to tabs for the purchase area. The filters didn't really make sense here.</li>
	<li>Bug fixes</li>
	<li>Added a new way to get block after world 10. I don't want to spoil it. But it's there.</li>
	<li>Added a few more soft reset rewards</li>
	<li>Finished implementing soft reset. Finally.</li>
	<li>All of the content additions I had planned are now implemented. The next few days will be all balance and bug fixes before 1.0</li>
	<li>Increased later game block upgrades, lowered growth rate of Gym cost.</li>
	<li>Implemented most of the soft reset rewards.</li>
	<li>Added a 'boss' mob to the end of certain worlds. He drops extra stuff.</li>
	<li>Added ability to give loot drops to certain mobs. Dragimps now drop some gems.</li>
	<li>Numbers lower than 10,000 no longer turn into K. It was actually longer.</li>
	<li>Added support for unrecyclable story maps. Added 1 unique map that cannot be recycled.</li>
	<li>Added button that allows maps to repeat automatically.</li>
	<li>Improved battle control buttons. Repeat maps and AutoBattle buttons now show as green when enabled, red when disabled.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug that was causing stacked upgrades to not properly display how many stacks there were.</li>
	<li>Completely rewrote formulas for equipment prestiging. Shield still needs a little love (I'm not 100% sure what I want to do with it yet), but the numbers and costs should scale nicely throughout the game now.</li>
	<li>More balance tweaks</li>
	<li>Not every upgrade earned from maps has to spawn in the last cell any longer. There will now be more than 1 upgrade in some maps, which should give players a little more freedom should they not want to grind the same level map 4 times.</li>
	<li>Reduced the wait time to start a new cell if Trimps win a fight (from 1 second to 0.1 seconds). It now takes 1.1 seconds to move through a cell if you one shot the bad guy, down from 2</li>
	<li>The attack, damage, block, and status bars of the battle screen now properly update when loading a new game or switching to exponential notation</li>
	<li>Spent some time with my monitor resolution set as low as it would go and made the new layout compatible with smaller monitors. <b>If the game does not display right on your monitor, please let me know your resolution and browser and I will fix it!</b></li>
	<li>Redesigned the map chamber. I'll come back later and see if I can color it up a bit, but it's way less confusing and way more functional now.</li>
	<li>Map chamber now also shows the amount of items available from each map as well as the map's native resource</li>
	<li>Fixed the grid display issues for real in maps.</li>
	<li>Scientific notation now uses less space and looks better</li>
	<li>New job: explorer</li>
	<li>Thar be Dragimps... a new upgrade, world unlock, and structure</li>
	<li>Random Death Text</li>
	<li>Battle grid now uses lists instead of a table. This should hopefully fix issues with areas not properly displaying.</li>
	<li>Game now switches automatically to exponential notation instead of "++" if numbers get too high (Thanks CuAnnan!)</li>
	<li>Added settings button to swap from standard to exponential notation</li>
	<li>Equipment can now be purchased in bulk</li>
	<li>Added 'custom' number button to purchasing options</li>
	<li>Rearranged the buttons for battle control</li>
	<li>Different map locations now have different types of primary resources. Mountains have metal, forests have wood, etc.</li>
	<li>Added new enemy types and defined new map locations for them</li>
	<li>Fixed issues with Internet Explorer</li>
	<li>Numerous small bug fixes</li>
	<li>Added a check to make sure that save files were properly written, and an alert for the player if a problem is detected</li>
	<li>Rewrote the way the game calculates prices for purchases of more than 1 item at a time, hopefully causing way less lag</li>
	<li>Made the tabs in the "Buy Column" function similarly to those of the message log.</li>
	<li>Old messages now get pruned, hopefully causing less lag</li>
	<li>Structures can now be purchased in bulk, with the exception of Forge, Shed, and Barn.</li>
	<li>Equipment has found a new home</li>
	<li>"Buy Column" buttons waste less space</li>
	<li>Messages waste less space</li>
	<li>Other things I forgot to write down</li>
	<li>Barn, forge, and shed have been rethought. Each structure costs 25% of your current maximum of the resource it increases (barns cost 25% of your max food, etc), and they increase that resource by 50%</li>
	<li>Major balance changes. Coordination no longer doubles, but scales at a rate of +10%, rounded up. </li>
	<li>Resources earned from battle are balanced in the long run, though they are way too prevalent early game </li>
	<li>Added some more foundation for increased mob types</li>
	<li>Fragments work more like currency now</li>
	<li>Lots of framework changes to help make balance easier</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">0.06 - 5/30/15</span>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug where structures earned in maps were unlocking more often than intended</li>
<li>Fixed Battleaxe prestige bug</li>
<li>Added 2 new housing structures to maps</li>
<li>Added 2 new upgrades (for the 2 new housing structures) to maps</li>
<li>Added a new bad guy, "Shrimp", which only spawns in maps that sound watery. They do nothing special, but they work.</li>
<li>The breeding Trimps counter works at numbers higher than 1000 now</li>
<li>Added a check when buying the "Coordination" upgrade. Said check will not allow you to purchase the upgrade if you do not have a high enough maximum population to battle with it.</li>
<li>You can no longer fight your way into negative employed Trimps</li>
<li>Added numbers to Jobs. You can click them to buy or sell more or less workers.</li>
<li>Reduced the exponential growth rate of job costs (they're cheaper later in the game now, you can buy more scientists and stuff)</li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">0.05 - 5/28/15</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: bold">I reset saves again. I'm sorry, but it had to be done, and I warned you! However, getting to World 5 should be much quicker than before due to some new balance tweaks.</li>
<li>In case you didn't notice, the UI is different. It's not totally done, but it's progress. I still haven't tested it on every screen size, but it's pretty responsive. If it doesn't work on your screen, zoom out, zoom in, or resize the window until it looks good as a temporary fix, then let me know what size screen you have and I'll fix it ASAP. Screens lacking in height may have some trouble.</li>
<li>Added maps system. After World 5, you'll start to find maps. The maps will generate with a level equal to the world you found them in. Maps have random names (though the names don't have any effect on gameplay), and they randomly generate size, difficulty, and a loot bonus within a range. You can find cool stuff in them, and I hope they're fun. </li>
<li>Maps can be recycled. Each recycled map gives you a map fragment. Once you get 3 map fragments, the game will generate a random map at the level of your current world.</li>
<li>Add new resource, Gems. Gems can be found by running maps, and are required for most upgrades found in maps. The higher the level of map, and the higher the loot bonus, the more gems you'll receive.</li>
<li>Added room for 2 more new resources. I haven't decided what they'll be yet, but they'll be sweet.</li>
<li>Added new building, Mansion. The schematic for Mansion can be found by running maps.</li>
<li>Added equipment prestiging. Starting with level 6 maps, you'll be able to unlock a prestige for all of the equipment earned in World 1. Level 7 unlocks World 2 equipment prestiges. Level 11 unlocks World 1 equipment prestiges again. The game has infinite equipment content now, hurray! (Balance not guaranteed to be good)</li>
<li>Added an upgrade to double the breeding speed of your Trimps, unlocked every 5th world.</li>
<li>Tooltip costs now show in green if you can afford that particular ingredient, and red if you cannot.</li>
<li>Added new message category and filter for "Notices". Notices show up in red in your chat log, and are generally important. I wouldn't recommend filtering out notices.</li>
<li>Trimps breed a teensy bit faster.</li>
<li>Bad guys hit a teensy bit softer.</li>
<li>Equipment is less powerful, but has gone down in price. The ratio of resource to stat points is still relatively the same, but slightly higher on the stat point side. (You get more stat points per resource spent now)</li>
<li>I again adjusted the resource rewards from battle. This is proving really tough to balance for some reason. Why did Jimmy P. Incrementalgameson (father of incremental games) make balance so difficult for developers?</li>
<li>Progress bars now go all the way across before resetting. </li>
<li>Added alert icon when you unlock something new. This goes away after a mouseover.</li>
<li>All known tooltip/text/grammatical errors are fixed. If you notice more, let me know. Please note that many of the upgrade names are a WIP</li>
<li>Equipment unlocks at the bottom of the equipment menu, but the menu scrolls down when something new is unlocked. People didn't like it adding stuff at the top for some reason. I'm not sure if this is better, but it's fun to test things.</li>
<li>I'm putting maps again because they took a long time to develop and probably nobody will read this anyway. If you're reading this, hi.</li>
<li>Numerous other small bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">0.04 - 5/22/15</span>
<ul>
<li>Made game slightly less angry when tabbing back in after being in the background for a long time. Still have work to do on this, but it should no longer be crashing.</li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">0.03 - 5/20/15</span>
<ul>
<li>Added auto-loading functionality</li>
<li>Added reset button</li>
<li>Fixed tooltip errors</li>
<li>Made game look much better on smaller monitors</li>
<li>Numbers larger than 999 get down with division</li>
<li>Made save string smaller</li>
<li>Resource rewards from battling now scale at a (hopefully) more appropriate rate</li>
</ul>



<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">0.02 - 5/15/15</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: bold">Due to heavy balance changes and content additions, saves were reset. Sorry :(</li>
<li>Started writing down updates</li>
<li>Moved log to bottom</li>
<li>Added filters to the chat log. Click to turn on or off.</li>
<li>Added icons to the start of each message to make stuff more noticeable by your eyeballs.</li>
<li>All text inside the log is black (for now). I may change the icon colors in the log based on the type of text, but I can worry about that later.</li>
<li>Left menu buttons are all on the right side</li>
<li>Lined up left menu text</li>
<li>Re-positioned some elements to feel less strange before everything is unlocked</li>
<li>Structures queue no longer stacks items together.</li>
<li>Added 'seconds' to structures queue progress bar</li>
<li>Structures queue progress bar now shows the correct amount of time remaining after finding one or more foremen</li>
<li>Removed feature that changed background color of elements when the player is gathering.</li>
<li>Gather/chop/mine/build/research buttons are now replaced with text if you're already gathering there, this should prevent confusion with people expecting to have to spam click in order to gather.</li>
<li>Added some icons to the gathering text for food, wood, and metal. I like that they make it easier to see where you're gathering, but I don't know if I actually like them. I don't have room for them on the left menu, so I'm undecided what I'm going to do there.</li>
<li>Moved a lot of stuff around in the battle section.</li>
<li>'Bad Guys' are gone. Instead, I have added a few random enemies with weird names (there will be more later, with different enemies for different worlds, etc). The randomized enemies have slightly different attack and health modifiers depending on who you're fighting.</li>
<li>The new enemies have a new stat which determines if they attack first or second. Certain enemies (by name) are faster than others. Half of the enemies will attack first, half will attack second. The animations (for now) still show both attacks at the same time, but the difference is noticeable if the faster opponent gets a killing blow.</li>
<li>Removed Medic (for now)</li>
<li>Added new stat, 'block', which only applies to Trimps (for now). By progressing through the battle system, you will unlock a structure that increases block by a flat number per Trimp. Later in the battle system, you'll unlock a Job that increases your total block # by 10% each. The flat number acts as a wood sink, the % acts as a food sink. I'm interested to see how people feel about this mechanic</li>
<li>Save strings get compressed to base64</li>
<li>Added import/export buttons (and added code that makes them do stuff)</li>
<li>Added a handful of new upgrades. The goal is to eventually have more than one upgrade available at any time, to force you to make decisions. The game is not at this point yet, but it is closer than last week.</li>
<li>You can now see a numerical representation of what World you're currently on. I plan to eventually add a randomized world naming system, but this is good enough for now.</li>
<li>Made tooltips render a little bit higher. Hopefully this should fix the issue some people were having where tooltips were generating below the screen. If you still have a problem with this, please let me know what your screen resolution is and I'll try my very hardest to fix it better!</li>
<li>Completely rewrote the game loop in order to support the game running in a background tab. I have never done anything like this, it was very scary (there's randomization in the battles, and the timing relies on breeding speed so there was a lot that could go wrong), but it SEEMS to be working fine. I haven't had a ton of time to really thoroughly test this, but please let me know if you notice a problem with it.</li>
<li>Clicking 'load' now resets the game first instead of just adding a second copy of everything to the screen.I have tested this a decent amount, but there could still be some bugs with the reset function. If you notice bugs after loading during a live game, let me know, refresh, then load again.</li>
<li>Enemy attack is lower, enemy health is higher, Trimp breeding speed is lower, equipment benefits are higher (and there is now a block mechanic, described above). This should keep the game moving at about the same pace as before, but prevent reaching a point where you start getting one shot and frustrated.</li>
<li>Added 'fire' button to jobs menu. This allows you to redistribute your workers. You will not receive a resource refund for firing a worker, but the price of the next worker of that type will go back down as if you had never purchased it.</li>
<li>Increased the amount of equipment in game. I tried really hard to tune it right, but I would really really love some feedback on the tuning.</li>
<li>A few other random surprises</li>
